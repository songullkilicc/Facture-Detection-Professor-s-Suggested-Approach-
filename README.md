# Forearm Fracture Detection – Professor's Suggested Approach

This folder contains the fracture detection project developed using the **methods suggested by my professor**.  
Unlike my custom pipeline (where I designed my own algorithm), this version mainly applies **different pipelines** recommended during the course.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To detect fractures in forearm MRI images using **classical image processing techniques** proposed by the professor.  
The aim was to test and compare various standard approaches, rather than creating a new algorithm.

---

## 🧪 Approach
- Multiple pipelines were implemented (edge-based, texture-based, pyramid methods, etc.).  
- Each pipeline followed a different methodology but all were based on **the professor’s suggestions**.  
- These methods relied purely on **image processing techniques** without developing a new custom algorithm.

---

## 📊 Results
- The professor’s suggested approaches were able to detect fracture regions to a certain degree.  
- However, compared to my **own custom pipeline**, these methods were more focused on applying existing techniques rather than innovation.

## 📌 Note
This project was implemented as part of the coursework requirements and mainly follows the **professor's guidance**.  
For my **own algorithm and unique approach**, please check the other project folder: [My Custom Approach](../My-Approach/).
